# Cost Toolkit Docs

Use this folder as the operational knowledge base for the migrated toolkit.

- `S3_SNAPSHOT_EXPORT_GUIDE.md` – Business case + step-by-step export/restore process for moving EBS snapshots into S3 Standard.
- `runbooks/` – Detailed procedural guides moved from `~/aws_cost`:
  - `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` – Python/VS Code environment bootstrap history.
  - `ROO_*` files – Roo embedding server + config notes.
  - `MANUAL_EXPORT_GUIDE.md` – Semi-manual export workflow paired with the automation scripts.
  - `COMPLETE_ROO_SETUP.md` & `IWANNABENEWYORK_DOMAIN_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` – Route53 + domain remediation narratives.
- `export_logs/` – Raw `manual_export_commands_*.txt` files generated by snapshot export tooling on July 23, 2025.

Add new runbooks or log snapshots here so every cost/migration activity stays documented next to the code.
