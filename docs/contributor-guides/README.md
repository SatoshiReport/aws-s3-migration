# Contributor Guides

This directory consolidates the helper documents aimed at coding assistants and other contributors who interact with the repository through automation. Use these references to stay aligned with the expected workflows and safeguards:

- `AGENTS.md` - general-purpose guidance for any automation agent (preferred coding style, testing expectations, and release practices).
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code specific tips and background context for this project.

Keeping these files under `docs/` reduces clutter in the repository root while keeping the material close to the rest of the operational documentation.
