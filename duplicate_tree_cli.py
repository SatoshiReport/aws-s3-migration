"""CLI workflow for duplicate tree analysis.

This module serves as a compatibility wrapper around the duplicate_tree package.
All functionality has been refactored into modular components:
  - duplicate_tree.analysis: Duplicate detection and clustering logic
  - duplicate_tree.cache: Cache management for analysis results
  - duplicate_tree.deletion: Directory deletion operations
  - duplicate_tree.cli: Command-line interface and main entry point
