# Bug Fixes and Improvements - S3 Migration Tool

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Glacier Files Could Never Be Downloaded After Restoration** (migrate_s3.py:204-211)
**Problem**: The migration loop filtered out ALL Glacier storage class files, even after they were successfully restored and available for download. This created a deadlock where:
- Glacier files were detected and restore was requested
- After restoration, files returned to `DISCOVERED` state
- But the filter blocked them based on `storage_class` still being `GLACIER`
- Files could never progress beyond this point

**Fix**: Changed the filter logic to only block Glacier files that haven't been through the restore process yet. A Glacier file is now considered ready for download if it has `glacier_restore_requested_at` set (meaning it went through restoration).

```python
# OLD (broken):
ready_files = [
    f for f in ready_files
    if not self.glacier.is_glacier_storage(f['storage_class'])
]

# NEW (fixed):
ready_files = [
    f for f in ready_files
    if not self.glacier.is_glacier_storage(f['storage_class'])
    or f.get('glacier_restore_requested_at') is not None
]
```

### 2. **Glacier Instant Retrieval Incorrectly Treated as Archived** (glacier_handler.py:15-20)
**Problem**: `GLACIER_IR` (Instant Retrieval) storage class was included in the list of storage classes requiring restore requests. However, Glacier Instant Retrieval provides immediate access to data just like STANDARD storage - no restore needed. This would cause unnecessary restore requests that would fail.

**Fix**: Removed `GLACIER_IR` from the `GLACIER_CLASSES` set, as it doesn't require restoration.

```python
# OLD:
GLACIER_CLASSES = {
    'GLACIER',
    'DEEP_ARCHIVE',
    'GLACIER_IR'  # Instant Retrieval - WRONG!
}

# NEW:
GLACIER_CLASSES = {
    'GLACIER',
    'DEEP_ARCHIVE'
}
```

### 3. **Multipart Upload Verification Would Always Fail** (file_migrator.py:101-128)
**Problem**: The ETag verification only handled simple MD5 checksums for single-part uploads. For large files uploaded via multipart upload, S3's ETag has the format `"md5-of-md5s-{part_count}"` (e.g., `"abc123-5"`). The simple MD5 calculation would never match, causing all large files to fail verification and be deleted.

**Fix**: Added detection for multipart ETags (they contain a dash). For multipart files:
- Verify file size matches (reliable check)
- Skip MD5 verification (can't reproduce without knowing original part sizes)
- Log a note that multipart verification is size-only
- Trust boto3's download integrity checks

```python
# Check if this is a multipart upload (ETag contains a dash)
is_multipart = '-' in expected_etag

if is_multipart:
    # For multipart uploads, rely on size check + boto3's integrity
    print(f"  NOTE: {bucket}/{key}: Multipart upload detected, using size verification only")
    checksum = f"multipart-{expected_etag}"
else:
    # Single-part: do full MD5/ETag verification
    ...
```

## Medium Priority Bugs Fixed

### 4. **Glacier Restore Status Check Could Incorrectly Mark Files as Failed** (glacier_handler.py:114-118)
**Problem**: When checking restore status, if no `Restore` header was present in the S3 object metadata, the code returned `'failed'`. However, this could happen for legitimate reasons (restore not yet requested, restore expired, etc.) and would permanently mark files as failed.

**Fix**: Changed to return `'in_progress'` instead of `'failed'` when restore status is missing, allowing the file to be retried. Added a warning message to help with debugging.

```python
if not restore_status:
    # Don't mark as failed, keep in current state for retry
    print(f"  WARNING: No restore status for {bucket}/{key}")
    return 'in_progress'  # Instead of 'failed'
```

## Improvements Added

### 5. **Added Error Reporting and Retry Capability**
**Problem**: Files that encountered errors would sit in ERROR state indefinitely with no way to:
- View what errors occurred
- Retry the failed files
- Get notified at the end of migration about failures

**Improvements**:
- Added `errors` command to display all files in ERROR state with details
- Added `retry-errors` command to reset ERROR files back to DISCOVERED for retry
- Migration completion now shows a summary of any errors encountered
- Better error visibility throughout the process

**New commands**:
```bash
python migrate_s3.py errors           # View all failed files
python migrate_s3.py retry-errors     # Reset failed files to retry
```

### 6. **Added Stuck File Detection and Recovery**
**Problem**: If the migration was interrupted during download/verify/delete operations, files could be stuck in intermediate states (DOWNLOADING, DOWNLOADED, VERIFIED) and would never be processed again, preventing migration completion.

**Improvement**: Added automatic detection of stuck files at migration start, with prompt to reset them:
```python
def check_stuck_files(self):
    """Check for and reset files stuck in intermediate states"""
    stuck_states = [FileState.DOWNLOADING, FileState.DOWNLOADED, FileState.VERIFIED]
    stuck_files = self.state.get_files_by_states(stuck_states)

    if stuck_files:
        print(f"\nFound {len(stuck_files)} file(s) in intermediate states")
        # Prompt user to reset them to DISCOVERED
```

### 7. **Improved File Size Verification**
Added explicit file size checking before ETag/MD5 verification as a first-pass validation. This catches incomplete downloads quickly before attempting expensive checksum calculations.

## Summary of Changes by File

### glacier_handler.py
- Removed GLACIER_IR from classes requiring restore
- Fixed restore status check to not incorrectly mark files as failed
- Added warning message for missing restore status

### file_migrator.py
- Added file size verification as first check
- Added multipart upload detection and handling
- Improved error messages with specific details

### migrate_s3.py
- Fixed Glacier file download filter to allow restored files
- Added `errors` command for viewing failed files
- Added `retry-errors` command for retrying failed files
- Added `check_stuck_files()` method for recovery from interruptions
- Added error summary display at migration completion
- Updated help text with new commands

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Glacier workflow**:
   - Scan buckets with GLACIER storage files
   - Run migration and verify Glacier files are restored and downloaded
   - Check that files progress through: DISCOVERED → GLACIER_RESTORE_REQUESTED → GLACIER_RESTORING → DISCOVERED → DOWNLOADING → DOWNLOADED → VERIFIED → DELETED

2. **Test multipart files**:
   - Migrate buckets containing large files (>5MB, uploaded as multipart)
   - Verify they complete successfully with size verification

3. **Test error recovery**:
   - Interrupt migration during download (Ctrl+C)
   - Restart migration and verify stuck files are detected and reset
   - Create a permission error and verify `errors` and `retry-errors` commands work

4. **Test Glacier IR files**:
   - If you have GLACIER_IR files, verify they download immediately without restore requests

## Migration Path

These changes are backward compatible with existing state databases. Files already in the database will work correctly with the new code.
